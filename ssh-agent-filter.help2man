[NAME]
ssh\-agent\-filter \- filtering proxy for ssh\-agent meant to be forwarded to untrusted servers
[DESCRIPTION]
ssh\-agent\-filter provides the unix domain socket interface of an ssh\-agent.
By default it forks and outputs shell code setting SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID, just like ssh\-agent does.

It filters each request according to its command line options.
No crypto operations are done by ssh\-agent\-filter; they are delegated to the upstream ssh\-agent.

ssh\-agent\-filter is not meant to be used directly, but through afssh.
